### Enhancing Accuracy with Data Augmentation and Dropout Regularization

In this notebook, we explored techniques to enhance the accuracy of our neural network model by addressing overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on validation data. To mitigate overfitting, we implemented data augmentation and dropout regularization.

#### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of images. This helps the model generalize better to new data. We used the following Keras pre-processing layers for data augmentation:
- `tf.keras.layers.RandomFlip`: Randomly flips the images horizontally and vertically.
- `tf.keras.layers.RandomRotation`: Randomly rotates the images by a specified factor.
- `tf.keras.layers.RandomZoom`: Randomly zooms into the images by a specified factor.

#### Dropout Regularization
Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This prevents the model from becoming too reliant on specific neurons, thereby reducing overfitting. We introduced `tf.keras.layers.Dropout` layers in our neural network.

#### Results
We trained three models:
1. **Original Model**: Without data augmentation or dropout.
2. **Augmented Model**: With data augmentation.
3. **Dropout Model**: With both data augmentation and dropout regularization.

The final validation accuracies for each model were as follows:
- **Original Model Validation Accuracy**: 0.5749
- **Augmented Model Validation Accuracy**: 0.5791
- **Dropout Model Validation Accuracy**: 0.5296

#### Differences in Validation Accuracy
- **Difference between Augmented and Original Model**: 0.0042
- **Difference between Dropout and Original Model**: -0.0453
- **Difference between Dropout and Augmented Model**: -0.0495

#### Conclusion
Data augmentation slightly improved the validation accuracy, indicating that it helped the model generalize better. However, introducing dropout regularization did not improve the validation accuracy in this case. This suggests that while data augmentation was beneficial, the dropout regularization might need further tuning or might not be as effective for this specific dataset and model architecture.
